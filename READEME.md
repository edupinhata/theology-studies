# Theology studies

This is a repository to organize my studies in theology. Like articles, sermons, books, etc.
Probably, most of the content will be in Portuguese unless something makes me to change to English.

##Interesting sites
- [Answers in Genesis](https://answersingenesis.org/en/): gather articles (some with references) about science related to Bible. 
Not sure yet how trustable the articles are, but it's an interesting source to search or read.
